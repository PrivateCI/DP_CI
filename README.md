# DP_CI
Here are the experiments for the paper: Confidence Intervals for Private Query Processing. The experiments are not complicated so I simplily present them in jupyter notebooks.

* Input data are stored in bank_marketing.csv adult.csv and HepPh.txt.

## Experiments on median CI:
  
* Synthetic.ipynb describes results on synthetic datasets
  
* medianCI.ipynb describes the results on real datasets

## Experiments on mean CI:
* meanCI.ipynb describes the experiments for mean CI.
  
##  Experiments on graph counting CI:
* Ladder.ipynb describes experiments on graph counting queries, the ladder functions are calculated according to https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2723372.2737785

##  Experiments on SQL query CI:
* Residual.ipynb describes the experiments on TPC-H queries, the residual sensitivities are calculated according to https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3448016.3452813


## DrawFigures.ipynb draws the figures used in the paper.
